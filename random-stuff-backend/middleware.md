# Middleware

Middleware is software that acts as an intermediate between the backend and the front end. It is a runner between the two platforms that allow users to access otherwise inaccessible functionality. For example:

* Middleware may run between a Windows machine and a Linux back-end.
* Middleware could be the piece that allows enterprise employees to use remote applications.

Middleware is also important for [application development and delivery](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/sdlc-software-development-lifecycle/). By understand the operating systems that a company uses to underpin its operations, a [software developer](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/application-developer-roles-responsibilities/) can account for the way in which an application will be distributed.
