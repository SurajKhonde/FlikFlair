# bcrypt

bcrypt is a library <mark style="color:red;">**used for hashing passwords.**</mark> Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function that converts an input (in this case, a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, which cannot be reversed to obtain the original input. This is commonly used for securely storing passwords in databases, as it makes it <mark style="color:red;">**difficult for attackers to obtain the original passwords even if they gain access to the hashed versions.**</mark>

bcrypt is particularly favored for password hashing due to its ability to incorporate a "salt" into the hashing process. A salt is a random value that is added to the password before hashing, which helps to mitigate attacks like rainbow table attacks, where attackers pre-compute hashes for commonly used passwords.

Here are some key features of bcrypt:

1. **Salted Hashing**: bcrypt automatically generates and includes a random salt when hashing passwords. This enhances security by preventing the use of precomputed tables (like rainbow tables) for cracking passwords.
2. **Adjustable Work Factor**: bcrypt allows you to specify the "work factor" or number of rounds used in the hashing process. Increasing the work factor makes the hashing process slower, which in turn increases the time and resources required for attackers to brute-force the hashed passwords.
3. **Resistance to Cryptographic Attacks**: bcrypt is designed to be resistant to various cryptographic attacks, including brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks.
4. **Consistent Hash Output**: bcrypt generates a hash output of a fixed length, regardless of the length of the input password. This ensures that the hashed passwords stored in the database are of a consistent size.
5. **Support Across Platforms and Languages**: bcrypt implementations are available for various programming languages and platforms, making it widely compatible and easy to use in different environments.

Overall, bcrypt is a popular choice for securely hashing passwords in web applications and other systems where password security is a priority. It provides a robust and efficient way to protect user credentials from unauthorized access.

```javascript
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");
```

we mostly use two methods here \
